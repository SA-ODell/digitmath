// Write a function that takes two numbers. For each number, you'll increase each digit by 1 except in the case of 9 where it will be turned into a 0. Then you'll add the two numbers together. For example:
//
// `oddAdd( 13, 50 ) >> 24 + 61 >> 85`
// `oddAdd( 49, 16 ) >> 50 + 27 >> 77`
//
// Assume that you may have numbers of varying length (that is, one digit or five digits) and that they will all be positive and greater than 0.
